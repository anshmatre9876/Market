<strong>Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) Prognostic Technologies Market Snapshot 2025-2033 provides a concise overview of market trends, forecasts, and growth opportunities over the forecast period:</strong>

Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are specialized rare cells, which have been shed from a primary solid tumor of the body and circulate in the vasculature system of the body, eventually causing metastasis. CTCs act as the seeds for successive development of additional metastatic tumors in distant organs, which is liable for the majority of cancer-related deaths. On the other hand, these fatal rare cells are capable of providing useful information of cancer patients, since their monitoring and detection is valuable for predicting the response to treatment and prognosis as well as staging of the disease.
